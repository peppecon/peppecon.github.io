Welcome!

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Economics at **Bocconi University** in Milan.

My research focuses on how workers sort across jobs and the consequences for human capital and wages. I am particularly interested in how uncertainty shapes the behaviour of firms and workers and how those responses affect the aggregate economy.

**Research interests**: Macroeconomics, Labor Economics, and Structural Econometrics.

        How does imperfect information about skills shape occupational sorting and wage growth over the life cycle? I address this question by developing and estimating a dynamic Roy model in which workers (i) enter the labor market with imperfect information about their multidimensional skills and (ii) accumulate task-specific human capital through work experience. Sorting on beliefs rather than true comparative advantage endogenously generates mismatch. Estimating the model on Portuguese administrative data, I find that skill uncertainty generates wage costs of 4.3% at labor market entry, declining to 1.3% after twenty years as workers learn and improve their sorting across occupations. These costs are concentrated among specialists, workers with strong comparative advantage in one dimension, while generalists lose little from uncertainty. Across demographic groups, female workers experience the largest losses. The framework provides a natural setting to study how information frictions affect labor market adjustment to technological change.
