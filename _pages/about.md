I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Economics at **Bocconi University** in Milan. My research interests are in **Macroeconomics**, **Labor Economics**, and **Structural Econometrics**. I study how workers sort across jobs and the consequences for human capital and wages. I am also interested in how uncertainty shapes the behaviour of firms and workers and how those responses affect the aggregate economy.
