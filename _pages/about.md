I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Economics at **Bocconi University** in Milan.

My research focuses on how workers sort across jobs and the consequences for human capital and wages. I am particularly interested in how uncertainty shapes the behaviour of firms and workers and how those responses affect the aggregate economy.
