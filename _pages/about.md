I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Economics at **Bocconi University** in Milan. During the Spring 2025, I visited Princeton University, hosted by [GianlucaÂ Violante](https://violante.economics.princeton.edu/).

My research explores **Macroeconomics**, **Labor Economics**, and **Structural Econometrics**, with a focus on how heterogeneity among workers and firms shapes aggregate economic dynamics and policy outcomes.

Outside academia, I enjoy playing basketball. In the last years, I have been playing with the Pelicans, the Bocconi Basketball Team.
