What are the consequences of early career skills mismatch for individual wages
and aggregate productivity? To answer this question, I develop and estimate a
general equilibrium dynamic Roy model in which workers have imperfect infor-
mation about their multidimensional skills and accumulate task-specific human
capital while working. Estimating the model on Portuguese administrative data,
I find that early career mismatch driven by information frictions generates a 6.7%
aggregate productivity loss. Individual wage losses are front-loaded and decline
over the lifecycle, but strong path dependence in occupational choices prevents a
substantial fraction of workers from reaching their ideal career path. I explore pol-
icy counterfactuals targeting this persistent mismatch. Reducing switching costs
by 50% lowers the aggregate output losses from mismatch from 6.7% to 3.7% and
eliminates the remaining lifecycle wage gap by mid-career. Fostering early-career
experimentation generates persistent wage gains later in the career, at the cost of
initial wage losses. Finally, I study how artificial intelligence affects the cost of mis-
match: I find that while AI increases the level of aggregate output, it also amplifies
the relative cost of mismatch due to information frictions about skills, raising the
aggregate productivity loss from 6.7% to 9.5%.
