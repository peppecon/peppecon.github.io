        How does imperfect information about skills shape occupational sorting and wage growth over the life cycle? I address this question by developing and estimating a dynamic Roy model in which workers (i) enter the labor market with imperfect information about their multidimensional skills and (ii) accumulate task-specific human capital through work experience. Sorting on beliefs rather than true comparative advantage endogenously generates mismatch. Estimating the model on Portuguese administrative data, I find that skill uncertainty generates wage costs of 4.3% at labor market entry, declining to 1.3% after twenty years as workers learn and improve their sorting across occupations. These costs are concentrated among specialists, workers with strong comparative advantage in one dimension, while generalists lose little from uncertainty. Across demographic groups, female workers experience the largest losses. The framework provides a natural setting to study how information frictions affect labor market adjustment to technological change.
