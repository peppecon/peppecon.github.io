What is the wage cost of imperfect information about skills? And how will artificial intelligence affect this cost? I answer these questions by developing and estimating a dynamic Roy model in which workers enter the labor market with imperfect information about their multidimensional skills and accumulate task-specific human
capital through work experience. Estimating the model on Portuguese administrative data, I find that information frictions about skills generate, on average, wage costs of 6.3% over the life cycle. These costs are larger early in the career and concentrated among specialists, while mismatch generated by information frictions
is less severe for generalists. Finally, while AI increases the overall wage level, it also increases the wage costs of information frictions from 6.3% to 8.6%.
